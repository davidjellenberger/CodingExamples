# CodingExamples

David Ellenberger - May 2018

# Description
A repo for aggregating coding examples to show companies. Contains code from three projects: 

1. Theater - a three facted program completed as part of a senior capstone course. Created in conjunction with two teammates, this folder contains the server, integration, and mobile app source code for our theater integration application. Each sub-folder has a readme with more information. My contributions were primarily on the server and integration sections, as well as the development of the unit tests. Primary languages are Javascript, Node.js, NPM, SQL, and Applescript

2. CoAuthor - an older mobile application created for our Mobile Computing Applications course. Essentially a poor man's google docs, we created an application for collabrative storytelling on android devices. Primary language is Java

3. Threads - a solo programming project for my operating systems course this year. Developed quick weberver to process individual, simple HTTP calls from a clientwith individual threads. A test for creating a Multithreaded application. Primary language is C, using the pthreads library

Each section will have its own READMEs with more information on specific implementation, mostly unchanged from their original submissions as school work.
